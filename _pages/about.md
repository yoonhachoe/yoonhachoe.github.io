As a graduate informatics student and a former AI software engineer intern, I have a proven track record of developing and deploying
cutting-edge AI models across various domains. I am interested in computer vision and natural language processing,
particularly generative AI, face reenactment, and 3D scene understanding. I am eager to pursue a career in deep learning as an AI
software engineer and research and implement state-of-the-art AI technologies to solve real-world business problems and drive
business growth.
